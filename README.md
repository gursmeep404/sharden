![Sharden Banner](./docs/sharden-banner2.png)

Sharden is a fintech-based secure data transfer platform designed to enable financial institutions and fintech companies to exchange sensitive data seamlessly over APIs and through encrypted file transfers. It has been built with end-to-end encryption, role-based access control, and real-time monitoring which ensures confidentiality, integrity, and compliance with industry standards while providing a developer-friendly API-first architecture for effortless integration.

## Features

### **1. Multi-Role Authentication & Access Control**

- **Separate Logins:** Supports three distinct roles â€” `User`, `Bank Employee (Fintech Employee)`, and `Third-Party Vendor` â€” each with dedicated access and permissions.
- **Secure Session Management:** User and vendor sessions last 24 hours by default when fintech company shares data of user with vendor and can be revoked by the bank at any time for enhanced security.
- **Role-Based Data Flow:** Each role has specific access to data and transfer services, ensuring that no unauthorized entity can view or tamper with information.

### **2. Secure Data Transfer via APIs**

- **Vendor Onboarding with Verification:**  
  New vendors must submit a registration form and get verified by the bank before receiving access credentials and a unique API token.
- **Token-Based Authentication:**  
  API access requires a user email, password, user token, and vendor token, ensuring that no external or unauthorized party can interact with the service.
- **Audit Logging:**  
  All API interactions, tokens, and data transfer events are logged in the database for complete auditability.
- **Rate Limiting:**  
  Built-in rate limiting protects the platform against DDoS attacks or malicious API calls.
- **Mailer Alerts:**  
  Users are instantly notified via email whenever their data is accessed or transferred.

### **3. Secure File Transfer (AES Encryption)**

- **Client-Side AES Encryption:**  
  Files are encrypted in the browser using AES before being uploaded, ensuring no plaintext file ever reaches the server.
- **Ephemeral Keys:**  
  The encryption key is never stored in the database; only metadata and the IV vector are stored for verification.
- **Secure Decryption:**  
  Vendors can decrypt files only if they possess the correct key or decryption link.  
  If the key is missing or invalid, decryption and download are impossible.
- **Automatic Browser Decryption:**  
  Upon download, files are automatically decrypted in the browser and then delivered as readable content.
- **Transfer Expiry:**  
  Every file transfer has an expiry time. Expired files are completely inaccessible, even with the key.
- **Revocable Access:**  
  Fintech employees can **revoke file access at any time**, preventing decryption even if the key/link is shared.
- **Mailer Notifications:**  
  Users receive alert emails for every file transfer event, adding another layer of transparency and trust.

### **4. Security Highlights**

- **End-to-End Encryption** with AES for files and secure token-based API communication.
- **24-Hour Session Management** with instant revocation by the bank.
- **Detailed Activity Logs** for both API calls and file transfers by storing everything in the database
- **Rate Limiting & Anti-DDoS** mechanisms to ensure service availability and resilience.

## Technical Stack

### **Frontend**

- **Next.js** â€“ For server-side rendering and routing.
- **React** â€“ Component-based UI for dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
- **TypeScript** â€“ Ensures type safety and maintainable code for the frontend.

### **Backend**

- **Node.js (API Backend)** â€“ Handles secure API endpoints, authentication, token management, and rate limiting for data transfer.
- **Flask (File Transfer Backend)** â€“ Powers secure file upload/download with AES encryption and decryption flows.

### **Database**

- **PostgreSQL** â€“ Stores user credentials, session tokens, vendor details, file metadata (excluding encryption keys), and logs for audit and monitoring.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run Sharden locally:

### **1. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sharden.git
cd sharden
```

### **2. Set Up the Database**

You can use PostgreSQL in two ways:

- Locally on your machine

Install PostgreSQL: [https://www.postgresql.org/download/]

Start the PostgreSQL server and create a new database (e.g., myapp_db)

Get your local connection URL (format: `postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/myapp_db`)

- Using NeonDB [https://neon.com/]

Sign up and create a project

Copy your connection string from the Neon dashboard

Example format:
`postgresql://user:password@ep-...neondb.io/db_name?sslmode=require`

ðŸ“„ Configure .env
Add your connection string to the .env file:

`DATABASE_URL="your_postgresql_connection_string_here"`

- Push Schema and Generate Client
  Run the following Prisma commands:

```bash
npx prisma db push        # Push your Prisma schema to the database
npx prisma generate       # Generate the Prisma client
```

### **3. Start API Backend**

```bash
cd user-first-service
npm install
cd routes
node server.js
```

- This starts the Node.js server for API-based secure data transfer.

### **4. Start the file transfer backend (Flask)**

```bash
cd secure_file_transfer
python -m venv venv # You can name your virtual environment whatever you want
venv\Scripts\Activate # In Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

- This starts the Flask server for secure file encryption/decryption.

### **5. Start the Frontend (Next.js)**

```bash
cd sharden_main
npm install
npm run dev
```

- Access the app in your browser at http://localhost:3000.
